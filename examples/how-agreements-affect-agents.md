## How Agreements affect Agents
![How Agreements affect Agents](how-agreements-affect-agents.png)

Unlike Agreements that did affect Agents, Agreements affecting Agents (i.e continuing to have an affect) are not a provenance scenario since it is not in the past, thus PROV-O relationships cannot be used. The simplest construct is given in Figure A where an Agent is a member of a Group and that Group is within the scope of (*inScopeOf*) an Agreement.
